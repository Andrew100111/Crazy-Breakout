Day 1 (Tuesday 9th, 2 hours):
Today I begin the project with Isaisas. We star talking about the divition and how to handle it. I start working on my working
environment. I installed Fedora 23, once it was ready through the terminal I installed: Dvelopment Tools, C Development and 
Tools Libraries, Fedora Eclipse. Because we are using GitHub as the git code manager, I add the plugin Egit and linked it 
with the repository Isaisas all ready set up.

I start a new document on Overleaf for the documentation file. It will be work on LaTex.

Day 2: (wednesday 10th, 2hours)

Isaisas shared with me a link with some code that were mostly of data structes. I downloaded two packages to check out. I will
start to compared them with my own data structres I made in Java last semester to build my own in C++.
