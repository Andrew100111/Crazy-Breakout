Day 1 (Tuesday 9th, 2 hours):
Today I begin the project with Isaisas. We star talking about the divition and how to handle it. I start working on my working
environment. I installed Fedora 23, once it was ready through the terminal I installed: Dvelopment Tools, C Development and 
Tools Libraries, Fedora Eclipse. Because we are using GitHub as the git code manager, I add the plugin Egit and linked it 
with the repository Isaisas all ready set up.

I start a new document on Overleaf for the documentation file. It will be work on LaTex.

Day 2: (wednesday 10th, 2hours)

Isaisas shared with me a link with some code that were mostly of data structes. I downloaded two packages to check out. I will
start to compared them with my own data structres I made in Java last semester to build my own in C++.

Day 3: (Thursday 11th, 2 hours)

Basically, today's work was much about continuing setting up the environment for the project. As mention the day before 
yesterday I linked up the Git with my IDE. I began making tests, about simple code: Hello World. I arrange the Master branch,
make some new folders. I made my own branch. 

I checked more code (structures) with Geany, the text editor. Problaby I will start 'coding' and adding those code to the 
git.
